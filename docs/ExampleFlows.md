Tyler Ninja Blevins wants to make a fortnite tournament to show off his world class skills. He first checks to see if there is any upcoming tournaments.(Get/Events/filter?status=upcoming?game=fortnite).He sees that there isn't any going on at the moment, so decides to make a new event and add a new category to our games list. 

- making new event: @post /Events/ --> returning id 
    passing personal information, time, duration, location.
- adds fortnite to our list of games: @post /games --> returning bool
    passing game information
